# Todo List for Decentralized Marketplace for Farmers DApp

## Overview

This todo list outlines the steps required to implement the decentralized marketplace for farmers, connecting them directly with buyers.

## 1. Foundry Setup

[done] Install Foundry and set up the development environment  
[done] Initialize a new Foundry project  
[done] Configure the project settings in `foundry.toml`

## 2. Smart Contract Development

[done] Develop the core marketplace contract (order management)  
[done] Create the escrow contract (payment handling)  
[done] Implement the reputation system (ratings and reviews)  


## 3. Testing

[done] Write unit tests for each smart contract using Foundry's testing framework (Forge)  
[done] Test the escrow functionality to ensure secure payment handling  
[done] Validate the reputation system and ensure ratings are recorded correctly  
[done] Conduct integration tests for the entire marketplace workflow

## 4. Deployment

[done] Script the deployment of contracts using Foundry  
[ ] Set up continuous integration for automated testing and deployment

## 5. Frontend Development

[ ] Build a Web3-enabled interface (React)
[ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness and wallet integration (MetaMask)

## 6. Backend Services

[ ] Use IPFS for document storage  
[ ] Integrate oracle services for external data  
[ ] Set up a notification system for user updates

## 7. Final Testing and Rollout

[ ] Test thoroughly on testnets to ensure all functionalities work as expected  
[ ] Deploy to the mainnet with a phased rollout strategy

## 8. Next Steps for Implementation

[ ] Start with Foundry setup and basic contract structure  
[ ] Implement core marketplace functionality first  
[ ] Add escrow and payment systems  
[ ] Build reputation mechanisms  
[ ] Create tokenomics model  
[ ] Develop frontend integration  
[ ] Test thoroughly on testnets  
[ ] Deploy to mainnet with phased rollout

## 9. User Onboarding

[ ] **Farmers:**
[ ] Register with farm details, location, and verification documents  
[ ] Set up wallet and receive farmer NFT credential  
[ ] Complete KYC/AML verification (optional decentralized identity)  
[ ] **Buyers:**
[ ] Simple wallet connection  
[ ] Option to complete profile for recurring purchases

## 10. Listing Process

[ ] Farmer creates a listing:  
[ ] Select produce type, quantity, quality grade  
[ ] Set price (fixed or auction)  
[ ] Add harvest date, farming methods (organic, etc.)  
[ ] Specify delivery options (pickup, shipping)  
[ ] Pay small listing fee in platform tokens  
[ ] Verify listing (automated or through DAO)  
[ ] Make listing visible in marketplace with search filters

## 11. Ordering & Payment

[ ] Buyer selects listing and places order  
[ ] Smart contract creates escrow:  
[ ] Lock buyer's payment  
[ ] Confirm order for farmer  
[ ] Record delivery details on-chain  
[ ] Options for buyers:  
[ ] Instant buy at listed price  
[ ] Make an offer (negotiation)  
[ ] Participate in batch auctions

## 12. Logistics & Delivery

[ ] Farmer prepares order and updates status  
[ ] Delivery options:  
[ ] Local pickup with QR code verification  
[ ] Third-party logistics (with tracking)  
[ ] Buyer pickup with time windows  
[ ] Optional IoT devices for:  
[ ] Temperature monitoring during transit  
[ ] Location tracking

## 13. Order Completion

[ ] Buyer receives and inspects order  
[ ] Confirm receipt in DApp:  
[ ] Release funds to farmer  
[ ] Both parties leave ratings  
[ ] Dispute resolution:  
[ ] Automatic release after X days if buyer doesn't confirm  
[ ] Disputes trigger DAO voting or third-party arbitration

## 14. Additional Features

[ ] Implement subscription boxes for CSAs (Community Supported Agriculture)  
[ ] Add bulk discounts for group buying options  
[ ] Track carbon credits and reward sustainable practices

## 15. Technical Architecture (Foundry Implementation)

[ ] **Smart Contracts:**

[ ] Develop core marketplace contract (order management)  
[ ] Create escrow contract (payment handling)  
[ ] Implement reputation system (ratings and reviews)  
[ ] Develop token contracts (utility and governance)  
[ ] Set up DAO governance (platform decisions)

[ ] **Frontend:**

[ ] Build Web3-enabled interface (React)  
[ ] Ensure mobile-responsive design  
[ ] Integrate wallet (MetaMask)

[ ] **Backend Services:**

[ ] Use IPFS for document storage  
[ ] Integrate oracle services for external data  
[ ] Set up notification system

[ ] **Foundry Development Workflow:**
[ ] Write and test contracts in Solidity  
[ ] Use Foundry's testing framework (Forge)  
[ ] Script deployment with Foundry  
[ ] Set up continuous integration

## 16. Next Steps for Implementation

[ ] Start with Foundry setup and basic contract structure  
[ ] Implement core marketplace functionality first  
[ ] Add escrow and payment systems  
[ ] Build reputation mechanisms  
[ ] Create tokenomics model  
[ ] Develop frontend integration  
[ ] Test thoroughly on testnets  
[ ] Deploy to mainnet with phased rollout
